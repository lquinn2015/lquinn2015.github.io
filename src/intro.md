# Overview
The point of this books is to document me learning llvm. I am not an expert but for
how important llvm is the compiler space I virtually have no grasp on how it works.
Thus to make it easier for me direct my learning and to make this more approachable
I'm creating this book. 

Currently I have little experience with mdbooks besides the
fact that I absolutely love the work they produce and how
transparent they are to create. I like latex but try hosting
pdfs converted via latex its not practical and it adds way
to many bumps along the way. 

# Why trust this author
You shouldn't I am not an expert on this subject but I do have
a strong background in a couple of key area's that make me intrested
in compilers to begin with. They Include Embedded Systems, Processor Design,
Reverse Engineering, and OS development. The rigour required to produce working
systems and analysis I think makes me qualified to learn most things and 
talk about that experience.
